# hello-realtime

Hello Realtime is a complete OpenAI Realtime application that supports WebRTC
users. You can access the app via WebRTC at https://hello-realtime.val.run.

This demo shows off the new all-in-one WebRTC API and the new server-side
websocket interface.

If you remix the app, you'll just need to pop in your own OPENAI_API_KEY (from
platform.openai.com).
