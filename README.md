# hello-realtime

Hello Realtime is a complete OpenAI Realtime application that supports WebRTC users.
You can access the app via WebRTC at https://hello-realtime.val.run.

This demo shows off the new all-in-one WebRTC API and the new server-side websocket interface.

If you remix the app, you'll just need to pop in your own OPENAI_API_KEY (from platform.openai.com).
